This is a cursed experimental playhouse filled with chaotic internet themes, random cats, deliberate misuse of modern tech functionality and its standards. Its not broken, just extremely thoughtful and calculated chaos

## what is this?
A chaotic digital sandbox made by [nullcat-dev](https://github.com/nullcat-dev) that explores:
- wild use -misuse- of coding standards
- UX is hell and its ruled by cats
- trashy UI, meme filled soul that fulfills the cringe meter in you
- stuff that should have died in 2000s repacked with modern algorithms and newer functionality
- randomness

## status
> complete degenerate level activeness on internet, new dev fresh out of college with zero skills, expect bugs, bad decisions and emotional damage

## Goals
- Make the best-worse website
- Learn real life technical skills through dumb projects
- Get an actual job where i regret making this dumb repo and get second had embarrassment
