# web-litterbox 🐾

this is a cursed experimental playhouse filled with chaotic internet themes, random cats, deliberate misuse of modern tech functionality and standards. its NOT broken, just extremely thoughtful and calculated CHAoS

## what even is this

a CHaoTiC DiGiTal Sandbox™ made by [nullcat-dev](https://github.com/nullcat-dev) that explores:

- wild use -MISUSE- of coding standards
- UX is HELL. and its ruled by CATS 😼
- trashy ui. meme filled soul. cringe dial goes to 13
- stuff that should’ve died in 2000s revived w/ modern helltech
- randomness? yes. logic? NO.

## status

> complete DEGENERATE level activeness online.  
> new dev. just graduated. zero real skills. this repo is therapy and trauma.  
> expect bugs, shame, bad ideas, and emotional DAMAGE.

## goals

- Make the best-worst-thing ever coded
- Learn real tech skills by breaking fake internet laws
- Get hired and PRAY no one finds this repo (they will.)

## future crimes (planned)

- raining cats if weather says rain
- sunbathing cat when it’s too hot
- snow cat wrapped like a burrito
